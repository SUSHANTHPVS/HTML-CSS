        <dt>Data Structures and Algorithms:</dt><br>
        <dd>Data Structures:
A data structure is a specific way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suited for different tasks and have varying trade-offs in terms of time and space complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. Common examples include:
Linear Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables.
Non-linear Data Structures: Trees (e.g., Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees), Heaps, Graphs.
Algorithms:
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem or perform a specific task. Algorithms often operate on data stored in data structures. Examples of common algorithms include:
Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search.
Graph Algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Problem-Solving Techniques: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Recursion, Backtracking.
Relationship and Importance:
Data structures and algorithms are intrinsically linked. The choice of a data structure directly impacts the efficiency of the algorithms that operate on it, and conversely, the requirements of an algorithm often dictate the most suitable data structure. Understanding DSA is essential for: 
Efficient Problem Solving:
Designing solutions that perform well, especially with large datasets.
Optimized Code:
Writing programs that consume minimal computational resources (time and memory).
Software Development:
Building robust and scalable applications in various domains like web development, artificial intelligence, and data engineering.
Technical Interviews:
DSA is a core component of technical interviews at many technology companies.</dd><br>
        <dt>Database Management Systems</dt><br>
        <dd>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software solution designed to efficiently manage organize and retrieve data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify and query databases while ensuring data integrity, security and efficient data access.

Unlike traditional file systems, DBMS minimizes data redundancy, prevents inconsistencies and simplifies data management with features like concurrent access and backup mechanisms. DBMS plays an important role in supporting data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.</dd><br>
        <dt>Machine Learning</dt><br>
        <dd>Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.
            Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.

Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.

Additional Types:

Self-Supervised Learning: Self-supervised learning is often considered a subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. 
Semi-Supervised Learning: This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

        <dt>Web Technologies</dt><br>
        <dd>Web development refers to building, creating, and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet, i.e., websites.

To better understand the foundation of web development, let's take a look at some core concepts and technologies used in the field
Web Development Classified Into Two Sections
There are two major areas: Frontend and Backend which forms the backbone of web development each plays a crucial role in creating seamless, functional web experiences.

Frontend Development:
In this module, we explore the core technologies that run in the user’s browser—the client side—including how web pages are structured, styled, and made interactive, building everything users see and interact with.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the language used to create the basic structure and content of web pages. It uses elements, tags, and attributes to organize text, images, and links.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style the HTML content. It controls colors, fonts, layouts, and how the page looks on different devicesMore importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
JS (JavaScript): JavaScript adds life to web pages by making them interactive. It handles things like buttons, animations, and form checks.</dd><br>
        <dt>Cloud Computing</dt><br>
        <dd>Cloud Computing is a technology that allows you to store and access data and applications over the internet instead of using your computer’s hard drive or a local server.

In cloud computing, you can store different types of data such as files, images, videos, and documents on remote servers, and access them anytime from any device connected to the internet.

Infrastructure: Cloud computing depends on remote network servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data.
On-Demand Access: Users can access cloud services and resources on demand, scaling up or down without having to invest in physical hardware.
Types of Services: Cloud computing offers various benefits such as cost saving, scalability, reliability, and accessibility. It reduces capital expenditures, and improves efficiency.
Architecture Of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and sub-components required for cloud computing. These components typically refer to:

Front end ( Fat client, Thin client)
Back-end platforms ( Servers, Storage )
Cloud-based delivery and a network ( Internet, Intranet, Intercloud )
1. Front End ( User Interaction Enhancement )
The User Interface of Cloud Computing consists of 2 sections of clients. The Thin clients are the ones that use web browsers facilitating portable and lightweight accessibilities and others are known as Fat Clients that use many functionalities for offering a strong user experience.

2. Back-end Platforms ( Cloud Computing Engine )
The core of cloud computing is made at back-end platforms with several servers for storage and processing computing. Management of Applications logic is managed through servers and effective data handling is provided by storage. The combination of these platforms at the backend offers the processing power, and capacity to manage and store data behind the cloud.

3. Cloud-Based Delivery and Network
On-demand access to the computer and resources is provided over the Internet, Intranet, and Intercloud. The Internet comes with global accessibility, the Intranet helps in internal communications of the services within the organization and the Intercloud enables interoperability across various cloud services. This dynamic network connectivity ensures an essential component of cloud computing architecture on guaranteeing easy access and data transfer.

Types of Cloud Computing Services
The following are the types of Cloud Computing:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
